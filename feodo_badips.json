	"info": "<a href=\"https://feodotracker.abuse.ch\">Abuse.ch Feodo tracker BadIPs</a>  The Feodo Tracker Feodo BadIP Blocklist only contains IP addresses (IPv4)  used as C&C communication channel by the Feodo Trojan version B. These IP addresses are usually servers rented by cybercriminals directly and used for the exclusive purpose of hosting a Feodo C&C server. Hence you should expect no legit traffic to those IP addresses. The site highly recommends you to block/drop any traffic towards any Feodo C&C using the Feodo BadIP Blocklist. Please consider that this blocklist only contains IP addresses used by version B of the Feodo Trojan. C&C communication channels used by version A, version C and version D are not covered by this blocklist. ",
